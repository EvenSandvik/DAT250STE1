
1. I didn't have much technical problems, I just found it a little tedious adding enviroment variables when setting up maven.

2. The command "heroku open" launched the heroku app, showing that the dev enviroment worked correctly. Also i version checked java and maven in the terminal to ensure they were installed properly.

3. The heroku platform was easy and straight forward to set up.
